# My Habit Tracker App

This habit tracker will help you create habits (and brake habits) by letting you custumize each habit, making it either daily, weekly, monthly or yearly; and checking it off everytime you complete it. The longer you keep your habits, the bigger your streak will be!

You can create a user profile (and have more than one user) and costumize habits from a preselected list, as well as delete and create habits. You will also be able to analize your data, knowing your ongoing habits (either all of them or separated by regularity), your longest streak (overall or for a given habit) as well as the starting date and the last time you completed it.

Breaking a habit will give you the possibility to track how much money and minutes you have saved, as well as setting a goal of days for you to have "broken the habit"
